**PWA One** is a digital identity manager, which is still under construction.

Why a digital identity project is named as `pwaone`? Because it is a Greek word, which means "nobody". It is a reference to the character in the Odyssey, who blinded the cyclops Polyphemus and then escaped by telling him that his name was "nobody".

I wish to be a **nobody** and a **everybody** in the digital world, and I wish you can be a nobody too, if you don't want to be traced.

There are some **other features** I wish to implement in the future, find them in the other posts.
