# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **PWA One**, the ultimate Web App store.

## Getting Started

Click [https://pwaone.com](https://pwaone.com) to get the PWA (Alpha version).

Notice that you are supposed to use it on cell phones. Although it's optimized for tablets or desktops, it's still useable.

## Why this app a PWA

Or why not react native or flutter? When usual people think about new things, they think of AppStore app.

I don't expect PWAOne to be listed on AppStore.

Hard to imagine a app store on AppStore. They want monopoly.

Could PWAs be unlisted or forced out on iPhones? No. Check here for Apple's newest failure removing PWAs [open-web-advocacy.org](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apple-backs-off-killing-web-apps/)

## Why there hasn't been a PWA store.

1. PWAs are not supported on IOS until recently.

2. People are `trained` to use AppStore / Google Play.

3. Missing of three key infrastructures

  1. One click login. (PWAOne features)

  2. Reliable pay system. (PWAOne features too)

  3. a store to search for PWAs and read the reviews. (That's PWA One gonna give you.)

## Why PWAs are better than AppStore Apps

1. Free and open. 

2. Easy to use

  1. PWAs are easy to install, no need for Apple id bullshits. Just 

  2. Easy to login. PWA One provide all kinds of one click logins

  3. Easy to uninstall. 

3. Smaller in Size.

  1. A typical PWA would be around 50 - 100Kb on your phone, while a similar AppStore App would be around 100Mb.

4. Easy to develop.

  1. Quick fix for errors. No more waiting for App Store scans. Just fix and deploy, everything is under your control.
