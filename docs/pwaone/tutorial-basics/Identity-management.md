# Identity Management

## 1. An insight to Web applications

:::info A secret

The thing stopping a web application from being used is login.

:::

Nowadays web applications are everywhere. And they are using the same old login system. You enter your email and password, and you are in. But this is not secure. And it's not user friendly. You have to remember your password, and you have to enter it every time you want to login.

## 2. Is there a better way to manage identity?

Few people are aware of the importance of identity management in the digital world. We just see people' identities being treated random. And it's happening in daily basis. Large companies are using phone numbers, email addresses, and social media accounts to identify their users.

This is a very dangerous practice, I personally, can login to a stranger's facebook account with my phone number. And if you read Chinese, here is another example: [Link](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LQ4y1n7Wb)

## 3. What is the solution?

The solution is to use a centralized identity management info infrastructure. This system will allow users to have control over their own identity. And it will allow them to use their identity in a secure and painless way.

## 4. centralized or decentralized?

In practice, centralized systems are inevitable.

Governments, who is already controlling our identities (in a quiet stupid way), need to take responsibility for bring the next generation of identity management systems to life.

But governments are incapable of creating new technologies. They are just good at controlling people. So, the solution is to create a centralized system, and let the governments to use it.

I am going to make the next generation of identity management systems. And I am going to make it open source.
