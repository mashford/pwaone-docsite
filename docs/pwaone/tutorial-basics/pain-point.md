# Why I make it.

## A unhealthy relationship

Last decades has seen the fallen of web as much as the raise of iOS / Android Apps. People stop using websites. They turned to Apps. 

And To make it even worse, user mindsets have been shaped by Apple. 

Average people just know to search names in a store for corresponding softwares.

It's an unhealthy relationship, between users, Apple and developers. Developers are controlled by Apple, they need to yield, please Apple and share their incomes. And Apple has actually the power of censorship. Apple could unlist, remove and ban a application at it's will, no matter how people want the app, and no matter how much effort developers has committed to the application.

Can we do sth to help stop Apple monopoly? EU forced Apple to allow side-load. But are there better ways to do it?

## Why people don't use web on mobile devices.

Bcs it's hard to use.

1. Most websites are designed years ago and for desktops. Using them on mobile device is hard. Designers on the other hand are not familiar with coding for mobile PWAs.

2. Logins are painful. Have you tried to type in a complex password with your tiny iphone keyboard? Do you want to type in every time? 

## A meaningless combat

Most cross-platform apps uses web stack or flutter. And people

## there are already Webview apps

Many Apps in AppStore are just wrapped web pages... Their number is larger than you think. 

Why bother make web apps AppStore apps? Is it because ...lack of a web app store?

If no others are interested in that, I would build it.

## Why HTML5 failed 10 years ago

refer to this [link](https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3262782/facebook-for-ios-native-app)

Now your new iphone15 is many many times faster than the iphones back then. A well designed PWA won't have a speed issue today.
