# Hide Element

Useing css, you can hide an element by setting the `display` property to `none`.

```html
<style>
  .hidden {
    display: none;
  }
```

Or you can use the `visibility` property to hide an element.

```html
<style>
  .hidden {
    visibility: hidden;
  }
```

Difference between `display: none` and `visibility: hidden`

- `display: none` removes the element from the flow of the document, and does not take up any space.
- `visibility: hidden` hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.
